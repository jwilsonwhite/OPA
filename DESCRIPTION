Title: Object Pattern Analysis for spatial patterns of two-dimensional objects
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: This package performs object pattern analysis (OPA) to detect overdispersion or underdispersion (clustering) of a spatial map of objects. This is intended to be used for objects that are better represented as a circle than as a point; that is, they occupy space in two dimensions and cannot overlap. OPA can calculate K and L statistics for objects that are analogous to Ripleyâ€™s K and L as calculated for point pattern analysis.
